# Installing Nova-Controller node #

### Controller node runs the Identity service, image service, management portions of Compute, management portion of Networking, various Networking agents, and the Dashboard. ###
### It also includes supporting services such as an SQL database,message queue, and Network Time Protocol(NTP) ###

##### * I recommend installing a controller node after installing compute node(Neutron) #####
